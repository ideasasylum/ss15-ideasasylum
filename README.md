# Redirect Your Traffic

A single-page app to create redirect rules based on the referrer header. 

These rules are executed by a small Javascript snippet insert on your site and configured using this app. Built with Backbone, Firebase, Bourbon, sweat, frustration and far too much time spent sitting on my arse.
